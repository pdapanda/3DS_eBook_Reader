[Download](https://github.com/reworks/3DS_eBook_Reader/releases/latest "Download the latest release here.")


## Instructions:
Place books in a folder named "books" on the *root* of your SD card.

Use calibre (google it) to convert other formats to .epub. Make sure its as strict as possible when converting.

MUST BE IN A VALID AND COMPLIANT .EPUB FORMAT. DRM-FREE EBOOK SHOPS ARE YOUR BEST BET.

## Building
You must first install devkitPro, libctru, sf2d, sftd, sfil and the portlibs. To get the zip on windows you will also need gnu32 zip + unzip binaries.

Then run "build-cia.bat" or "build-cia.sh" depending on your platform.
